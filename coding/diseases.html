        <h2>Abnormal heart rhythms, or arrhythmias</h2>
        <h4>An arrhythmia is an abnormality of the heart's rhythm. It may beat too slowly, too quickly, or irregularly. These abnormalities range from a minor inconvenience or discomfort to a potentially fatal problem.</h4>

        <h2>Aorta disease and Marfan syndrome</h2>
        <h4>Some complications of Marfan syndrome can be very serious, like an aneurysm (bulge) of the aorta, the main artery that takes blood away from the heart. An aortic aneurysm can cause the walls of the aorta to tear apart (dissect) and blood to leak
            in the space created by the tear.</h4>

        <h2>Congenital heart disease</h2>
        <h4>CHDs are present at birth and can affect the structure of a baby's heart and the way it works. They can affect how blood flows through the heart and out to the rest of the body. CHDs can vary from mild (such as a small hole in the heart) to severe
            (such as missing or poorly formed parts of the heart).</h4>

        <h2>Coronary artery disease (narrowing of the arteries)</h2>
        <h4>Coronary artery disease is caused by plaque buildup in the wall of the arteries that supply blood to the heart.Plaque is made up of cholesterol deposits. Plaque buildup causes the inside of the arteries to narrow over time. This process is called
            atherosclerosis.
        </h4>

        <h2>Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism</h2>
        <h4>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition in which a blood clot develops in the deep veins, most commonly in the lower extremities. A pulmonary embolism occurs when a part of the clot breaks off and travels to the lungs, a potential life threat.</h4>

        <h2>Heart attack</h2>
        <h4>A heart attack, also called a myocardial infarction, happens when a part of the heart muscle doesn't get enough blood. The more time that passes without treatment to restore blood flow, the greater the damage to the heart muscle.</h4>

        <h2>Heart failure</h2>
        <h4>Heart failure means that the heart is unable to pump blood around the body properly. It usually happens because the heart has become too weak or stiff.</h4>

        <h2>Heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy)</h2>
        <h4>The most common cause is coronary artery disease or heart attack. However, it can also be caused by genetic changes. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This type involves abnormal thickening of the heart muscle, which makes it harder for the heart to
            work.
        </h4>

        <h2>Heart valve disease</h2>
        <h4>In heart valve disease, one or more of the valves in your heart doesn't work properly. Your heart has four valves that keep blood flowing in the correct direction. In some cases, one or more of the valves don't open or close properly. This can
            cause the blood flow through your heart to your body to be disrupted.</h4>

        <h2>Pericardial disease</h2>
        <h4>Pericardial effusion is the buildup of too much fluid in the double-layered, saclike structure around the heart (pericardium). The space between these layers typically contains a thin layer of fluid.</h4>

        <h2>Peripheral vascular disease</h2>
        <h4>Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) is a slow and progressive circulation disorder. Narrowing, blockage, or spasms in a blood vessel can cause PVD. PVD may affect any blood vessel outside of the heart including the arteries, veins, or lymphatic
            vessels.
        </h4>

        <h2>Rheumatic heart disease</h2>
        <h4>Rheumatic heart disease is a condition in which the heart valves have been permanently damaged by rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that can affect many connective tissues, especially in the heart. Untreated or under-treated
            strep infections put a person at increased risk.</h4>

        <h2>Stroke</h2>
        <h4>A stroke, sometimes called a brain attack, occurs when something blocks blood supply to part of the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts. In either case, parts of the brain become damaged or die. A stroke can cause lasting brain damage,
            long-term disability, or even death.</h4>

        <h2>Vascular disease (blood vessel disease)</h2>
        <h4>Vascular disease (vasculopathy) affects the blood vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients throughout your body and remove waste from your tissues. Common vascular problems happen because plaque (made of fat and cholesterol) slows down or blocks
            blood flow inside your arteries or veins</h4>
